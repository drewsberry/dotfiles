This is a list of features I should implement in the future.

## Username independent zshmarks

Alter the zshmarks plugin so that `$HOME` is used for home directory bookmarks, making them thereby independent of your `$HOME` directory name. This will make it both username independent for use on multiple machines with different usernames, and cross-platform, so the same `.bookmarks` file can be used for different platforms.
